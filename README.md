# School District Analysis

## Overview of Project
This project is to analyze data for budget spent on the students from 15 different schools on the scores of Math and Reading from grades 9th to 12th.

## Analysis and Challenges
The challenge was that after analyzing the data it was reported that the data for the 9th grade students from Thomas High School was erroneous. This challenge was overcome by replacing that data with null values and re-analyzing it.

### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to present various summaries as follows:
1. Cleaned and merged dataframe of students and school information
2. Math and Reading scores for various schools according to the grades
4. A summary of the totals including total budget, students and the average and overall scores.
5. Schools categorized as Small, Medium and Large
6. Top 5 schools and bottom 5 schools

## Results
With the removal of erroneous data from Thomas high school for 9th grade, the math and reading scores are slightly reduced by around 0.1
